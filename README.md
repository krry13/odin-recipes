First project from TOP

During this project I was able to learn how to make new repo at GitHub and how to clone it to my computer. Also Git basics was discovered, like: status, log, add, restore, commit, push. Learned how to commit, push and sync using VS Code.

It was not my first steps with HTML, but it was nice refresher for me to use basic elements like headings, paragraphs, anchors, images, ul, ol...

Finally I learned how to publish sites using GitHub.
